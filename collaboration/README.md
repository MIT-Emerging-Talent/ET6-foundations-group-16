# Collaboration

Our group is committed to fostering a respectful and supportive environment. 
We honor each other's time and cultural differences while providing flexible 
communication channels to accommodate diverse schedules.

## Group Norms

- We will respect each other's time while remaining flexible and understanding 
  of unforeseen delays.

- We will create a supportive space that acknowledges cultural differences by 
  asking for and offering help and encouragement to teammates facing challenges.

- We will provide various communication channels, both synchronous and 
  asynchronous, to accommodate the different availability times of group members.

- We will provide constructive criticism while considering unforeseen challenges 
  and refrain from assigning blame.

- If a breach of trust occurs, we will evaluate the mistakes that led to it, 
  learn from them, and implement strategies to prevent similar issues in the 
  future.

- We will use discussions to explore ideas and debates to make decisions.
