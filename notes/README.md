# Notes

Welcome to the **Notes** directory! 🎉

This is our little corner of the project where we share all the gems we pick up
along the way. 🧠✨

Here’s what you’ll find (and what you’re welcome to add):  

- 🖋️ **What We're Learning:** Got a cool trick in Git? Learned a new design pattern? Found a clever way to squash bugs? Share it here!  
- 😂 **Funny Moments:** Code reviews aren’t always serious — if something made you laugh (or cry), jot it down! Laughter is the best debugging tool.
