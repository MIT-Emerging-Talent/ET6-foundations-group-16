    """Checks if a number is prime.

    A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
    This function checks if the given number is prime by testing divisibility for all numbers
    from 2 to the square root of the number.

    Parameters:
        number: int, the number to check for prime. Must be greater than 1.

    Returns:
        bool: True if the number is prime, False otherwise.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the number is less than or equal to 1.

    Examples:
        >>> check_prime_number(2)
        True
        >>> check_prime_number(3)
        True
        >>> check_prime_number(4)

        >>> check_prime_number(13)
