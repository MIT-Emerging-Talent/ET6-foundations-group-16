"""
This module contains unit tests for the `longest_word` function.

The tests verify that the `longest_word` function works as expected for a variety of
valid and invalid inputs, including boundary cases.

Tests include:
- Valid sentence inputs containing multiple words.
- Sentences with a single word.
- Empty strings to test for error handling.
- Non-string inputs to ensure a `ValueError` is raised.
- Sentences with multiple longest words to check if the first encountered word is returned.

The tests ensure that the function returns the correct longest word, and that it raises an
`AssertionError` when given invalid inputs such as non-string values or empty strings.
